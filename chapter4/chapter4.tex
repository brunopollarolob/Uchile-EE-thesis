\chapter{F-engine design}
Firmware development for this project was carried out using the graphical Simulink environment, leveraging blocks from the \gls{casper} framework \citep{hickish2016decadedevelopingradioastronomyinstrumentation}. CASPER offers a library of pre-built modules for common DSP operations, such as FFTs, cross-correlations, and filtering, that can be easily combined to implement complex signal processing pipelines for radio astronomy applications.
This allows digital architectures to be designed through functional blocks and visual connections, simplifying development compared to traditional hardware description languages like VHDL or Verilog. The CASPER toolflow also includes a compilation process that translates the Simulink designs into synthesizable HDL code, which can then be implemented on FPGA hardware. This approach significantly reduces development time and effort, enabling rapid prototyping and iteration of designs.
