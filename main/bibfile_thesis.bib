    abstract = {A study is made of the implications of the recent polarization measurements for the structures of discrete radio sources and the source–observer media. Simple models of wavelength-dependent depolarizing mechanisms are investigated and it is found that most are incompatible with the observations of Gardner \&amp; Whiteoak. The models of internal Faraday dispersion predict a lower polarization at 30 cm than is observed. It is suggested that the depolarization of the Crab nebula is produced by Faraday rotation in the filamentary shell that surrounds the nebula. Such filaments could also exist in the outer regions of extragalactic sources.A complex number representation is used for the state of linear polarization and a Faraday dispersion function is defined to describe the distribution of polarized radiation with respect to Faraday depth. The persistence of polarization at 30 cm, after partial depolarization between 10 cm and 20 cm, implies that the radiation is spread over a large range of Faraday depths. The observed linearity of the plot of the angle of polarization against wavelength squared for most sources implies that it is justifiable to make an assumption which enables one to calculate the Faraday dispersion function of a source from the dependence of its polarization on wavelength.Estimates are given for upper limits to the densities of internal ionized gases in the sources for which we have polarization measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {The volume of research on fast radio bursts (FRBs) observation have been seeing a dramatic growth. To facilitate the systematic analysis of the FRB population, we established a database platform, Blinkverse, as a central inventory of FRBs from various observatories and with published properties, particularly dynamic spectra from FAST, CHIME, GBT, Arecibo, etc. Blinkverse thus not only forms a superset of FRBCAT, TNS, and CHIME/FRB, but also provides convenient access to thousands of FRB dynamic spectra from FAST, some of which were not available before. Blinkverse is regularly maintained and will be updated by external users in the future. Data entries of FRBs can be retrieved through parameter searches through FRB location, fluence, etc., and their logical combinations. Interactive visualization was built into the platform. We analyzed the energy distribution, period analysis, and classification of FRBs based on data downloaded from Blinkverse. The energy distributions of repeaters and non-repeaters are found to be distinct from one another.},

title = {First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio ≳10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 M⊙. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.}

The author has worked on many of the topics in the text; his experience is reflected in the interesting and cohesive perspectives related to the different subjects discussed and in the adaptation of calculations from his own work to new, substantial, and intriguing problems.Each chapter has two short introductions: one to outline its contents and the other to discuss the exercises at the end of the chapter.

RFSoC devices are the first adaptive SoCs (Systems-on-Chip) to monolithically integrate multiple RF signal chains along with Arm application and real-time, multicore processors and programmable logic. RFSoC is not so much a radio on a chip, but almost an entire base station on a chip! We anticipate that the book will be of interest and use across a number of technical areas. It serves as an introduction to the family of RFSoC devices and its key features and programmability. The book explores SDR concepts and architecture and key DSP algorithms.A selection of hands-on exercises via Jupyter Lab notebooks accompany the book and are available from the companion GitHub repository",

title = {The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project: System Overview},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a novel transit radio telescope operating across the 400–800 MHz band. CHIME is composed of four 20 m × 100 m semicylindrical paraboloid reflectors, each of which has 256 dual-polarization feeds suspended along its axis, giving it a ≳200 deg2 field of view. This, combined with wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, and a powerful correlator, makes CHIME an excellent instrument for the detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB) will search beam-formed, high time and frequency resolution data in real time for FRBs in the CHIME field of view. Here we describe the CHIME/FRB back end, including the real-time FRB search and detection software pipeline, as well as the planned offline analyses. We estimate a CHIME/FRB detection rate of 2–42 FRBs sky–1 day–1 normalizing to the rate estimated at 1.4 GHz by Vander Wiel et al. Likely science outcomes of CHIME/FRB are also discussed. CHIME/FRB is currently operational in a commissioning phase, with science operations expected to commence in the latter half of 2018.}

abstract = {The complex characteristics and implicit regulations contained in astronomical radio data have aggravated the dilemma in astronomy data processing. In this case, data preprocessing has become an essential step to provide solutions by means of data compression, feature extraction, format transformation, information coding, and so on. Many of the methods enable scalable and parallel design approaches to achieve further acceleration, among which the FPGA pipeline is an efficient and adaptable technology for most datasets. This chapter introduces ADC, filtering, time-frequency transforming, and correlator and data reduction on FPGA as the preprocessing pipeline. Moreover, the FPGA pipeline technology will be demonstrated in detail, and the specific design issues will be displayed as a reference. Through these discussions, readers can have a better understanding of the design concepts in data preprocessing.}
