    abstract = {A study is made of the implications of the recent polarization measurements for the structures of discrete radio sources and the source–observer media. Simple models of wavelength-dependent depolarizing mechanisms are investigated and it is found that most are incompatible with the observations of Gardner \&amp; Whiteoak. The models of internal Faraday dispersion predict a lower polarization at 30 cm than is observed. It is suggested that the depolarization of the Crab nebula is produced by Faraday rotation in the filamentary shell that surrounds the nebula. Such filaments could also exist in the outer regions of extragalactic sources.A complex number representation is used for the state of linear polarization and a Faraday dispersion function is defined to describe the distribution of polarized radiation with respect to Faraday depth. The persistence of polarization at 30 cm, after partial depolarization between 10 cm and 20 cm, implies that the radiation is spread over a large range of Faraday depths. The observed linearity of the plot of the angle of polarization against wavelength squared for most sources implies that it is justifiable to make an assumption which enables one to calculate the Faraday dispersion function of a source from the dependence of its polarization on wavelength.Estimates are given for upper limits to the densities of internal ionized gases in the sources for which we have polarization measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {The volume of research on fast radio bursts (FRBs) observation have been seeing a dramatic growth. To facilitate the systematic analysis of the FRB population, we established a database platform, Blinkverse, as a central inventory of FRBs from various observatories and with published properties, particularly dynamic spectra from FAST, CHIME, GBT, Arecibo, etc. Blinkverse thus not only forms a superset of FRBCAT, TNS, and CHIME/FRB, but also provides convenient access to thousands of FRB dynamic spectra from FAST, some of which were not available before. Blinkverse is regularly maintained and will be updated by external users in the future. Data entries of FRBs can be retrieved through parameter searches through FRB location, fluence, etc., and their logical combinations. Interactive visualization was built into the platform. We analyzed the energy distribution, period analysis, and classification of FRBs based on data downloaded from Blinkverse. The energy distributions of repeaters and non-repeaters are found to be distinct from one another.},

title = {First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio ≳10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 M⊙. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.}

It covers an appropriate selection of topics, and the amount of detail presented is suitable for an introductory course. The author has worked on many of the topics in the text; his experience is reflected in the interesting and cohesive perspectives related to the different subjects discussed and in the adaptation of calculations from his own work to new, substantial, and intriguing problems.Each chapter has two short introductions: one to outline its contents and the other to discuss the exercises at the end of the chapter. The introductions are most useful for providing context, and they help the flow of the presentation. The one choice made by the author with which I disagree is that he did not provide literature recommendations when he did not cover a topic in depth.},

RFSoC devices are the first adaptive SoCs (Systems-on-Chip) to monolithically integrate multiple RF signal chains along with Arm application and real-time, multicore processors and programmable logic. RFSoC is not so much a radio on a chip, but almost an entire base station on a chip! We anticipate that the book will be of interest and use across a number of technical areas. It serves as an introduction to the family of RFSoC devices and its key features and programmability. The book explores SDR concepts and architecture and key DSP algorithms.A selection of hands-on exercises via Jupyter Lab notebooks accompany the book and are available from the companion GitHub repository",

title = {The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project: System Overview},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a novel transit radio telescope operating across the 400–800 MHz band. CHIME is composed of four 20 m × 100 m semicylindrical paraboloid reflectors, each of which has 256 dual-polarization feeds suspended along its axis, giving it a ≳200 deg2 field of view. This, combined with wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, and a powerful correlator, makes CHIME an excellent instrument for the detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB) will search beam-formed, high time and frequency resolution data in real time for FRBs in the CHIME field of view. Here we describe the CHIME/FRB back end, including the real-time FRB search and detection software pipeline, as well as the planned offline analyses. We estimate a CHIME/FRB detection rate of 2–42 FRBs sky–1 day–1 normalizing to the rate estimated at 1.4 GHz by Vander Wiel et al. Likely science outcomes of CHIME/FRB are also discussed. CHIME/FRB is currently operational in a commissioning phase, with science operations expected to commence in the latter half of 2018.}

title = {Localizing FRBs through VLBI with the Algonquin Radio Observatory 10 m Telescope},
journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB experiment has detected thousands of fast radio bursts (FRBs) due to its sensitivity and wide field of view; however, its low angular resolution prevents it from localizing events to their host galaxies. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), triggered by FRB detections from CHIME/FRB will solve the challenge of localization for non-repeating events. Using a refurbished 10 m radio dish at the Algonquin Radio Observatory located in Ontario Canada, we developed a testbed for a VLBI experiment with a theoretical λ/D ≲ 30 mas. We provide an overview of the 10 m system and describe its refurbishment, the data acquisition, and a procedure for fringe fitting that simultaneously estimates the geometric delay used for localization and the dispersive delay from the ionosphere. Using single pulses from the Crab pulsar, we validate the system and localization procedure, and analyze the clock stability between sites, which is critical for coherently delay referencing an FRB event. We find a localization of ∼200 mas is possible with the performance of the current system (single-baseline). Furthermore, for sources with insufficient signal or restricted wideband to simultaneously measure both geometric and ionospheric delays, we show that the differential ionospheric contribution between the two sites must be measured to a precision of 1 × 10−8 pc cm−3 to provide a reasonable localization from a detection in the 400–800 MHz band. Finally we show detection of an FRB observed simultaneously in the CHIME and the Algonquin 10 m telescope, the first non-repeating FRB in this long baseline. This project serves as a testbed for the forthcoming CHIME/FRB Outriggers project.}

In this case, data preprocessing has become an essential step to provide solutions by means of data compression, feature extraction, format transformation, information coding, and so on. Many of the methods enable scalable and parallel design approaches to achieve further acceleration, among which the FPGA pipeline is an efficient and adaptable technology for most datasets. This chapter introduces ADC, filtering, time-frequency transforming, and correlator and data reduction on FPGA as the preprocessing pipeline. Moreover, the FPGA pipeline technology will be demonstrated in detail, and the specific design issues will be displayed as a reference. Through these discussions, readers can have a better understanding of the design concepts in data preprocessing.}
